# Phishing Email Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

This project is designed to detect phishing emails by analyzing the text content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). This project will help me understand how to preprocess email text, extract meaningful features, and build a simple classifier to differentiate phishing emails from legitimate ones.

## Project Structure

1. **Set Up the Environment**: Install Python and essential libraries.
2. **Gather the Dataset**: Use a dataset containing phishing and non-phishing emails (such as the Enron Email Dataset).
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the email text data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Transform text data into numerical features that the model can process.
5. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to classify emails.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Testing and Improvement**: Test the model on new samples and improve if necessary.

### Set up the Environment

To set up the environment, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
```

**Libraries Used**
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For handling numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, data splitting, and model evaluation.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text processing, tokenization, and removing stopwords.
OR
spaCy: Another NLP library (alternative to NLTK) used for more complex NLP tasks.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualizing steps.
